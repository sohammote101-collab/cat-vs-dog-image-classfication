My project is on Dogs vs Cats Image Classification using CNN.
We used a dataset of 25,000 images, cleaned it, and split into training and testing sets.
Images were preprocessed with normalization and augmentation like rotation and flipping.
A CNN model was built with convolution, pooling, and dense layers. It was trained for 10 epochs and achieved good accuracy.
Finally, the model successfully predicts whether an image is a cat or dog.

In short, this project proves CNN is powerful for image classification tasks.‚Äù
